Imagine that you are preparing a project with your friend. You have found some interesting material for the presentation and you want to read this text to your friend. You have 1.5 minutes to read the text silently, then be ready to read it out aloud. You will not have more than 1.5 minutes to read it.
It’s hard to imagine a world without iPhones, Instagram, or YouTube. But not long ago, these essential pieces of technology didn’t even exist. In just a few short decades, technology has infiltrated our businesses, homes, and lives. It’s not going anywhere and only becoming more integrated into all aspects of our existence.
How technology will affect future jobs is unclear, but there are many indicators and predictions that technology could take away millions of jobs soon. In fact, by 2030 we’ll likely lose 73 million jobs to automation.
While this might seem discouraging, the future also holds many new job prospects for college graduates, particularly in knowledge creation and innovation. Advancements in machinery and technology will provide graduates with the tools to explore, experiment, and find unique solutions to complex problems.
