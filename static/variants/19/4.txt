Imagine that you are doing a project "Work throughout one's life" together with your friend. You have found some illustrations and want to share the news. Leave a voice message to your friend. In 2.5 minutes be ready to tell the friend about the photos:
•	give a brief description of the photos (2 features connected with the subject of the project in each photo minimum);
•	say in what way the pictures are different (2 features connected with the subject of the project minimum);
•	mention the advantages and disadvantages (1–2) of completing schoolwork versus working for an employer;
•	explain how these photos illustrate the project "Work throughout one's life";
•	express your opinion on the subject of the project – whether you prefer work as a way to learn or a way to earn money.
You will speak for not more than 3 minutes (2–3 sentences for every item of the plan, 12–15 sentences total). You have to talk continuously.
