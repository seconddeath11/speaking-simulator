Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, is a character from folk tales and legends. He is depicted as a big and cheerful white-bearded man wearing a red suit with white trim. In some countries, he is said to live at the North Pole with his wife Mrs Claus, elves who are said to build his toys, and reindeer who are said to pull his sleigh through the sky. Santa is said to bring gifts to small, good children worldwide on Christmas usually by sliding down fireplace chimneys and reindeer pulling his sleigh. However, after the children have fallen asleep, parents typically play the role of Santa Claus and leave their gifts under the Christmas tree. Santa Claus is not a real, historical person but the modern character of Santa was most likely created from different traditions from European and Christian culture. The Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of Santa Clauses is held in India, where 18,112 Santas got together in one place on the 27th of December 2014.
