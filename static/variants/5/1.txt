Extreme sports, also known as alternative sports, are nontraditional sports and activities that require athletic skills with considerable risks and a high level of danger. These activities often involve speed, height and a lot of physical training. Among extreme sports there is ski jumping, sky surfing, skateboarding, powerful racing and many others.
Special equipment is needed to do extreme sports. For surfing you need a surfboard and swimming kits. For snowboarding you need a snowboard, special boots, sunglasses and a helmet. For BMX sport you need a special bike with small wheels.
People in extreme sports compete not only against each other, but also against weather conditions and enormous difficulties. Many new adventure sports are likely to appear soon.
