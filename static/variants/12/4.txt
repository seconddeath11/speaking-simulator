•	say in what way the pictures are different (2 features connected with the subject of the project minimum);
•	mention the advantages and disadvantages (1–2) of the two types of healthy lifestyles;
•	explain how these photos illustrate the project “Healthy living”;
•	express your opinion on the subject of the project – the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
You will speak for not more than 3 minutes (2–3 sentences for every item of the plan, 12–15 sentences total). You have to talk continuously.
