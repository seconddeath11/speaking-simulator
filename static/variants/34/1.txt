There are many types of family systems around the world. In North America and northern Europe, the nuclear family is often seen as the most typical. In contrast, in most other parts of the world, extended families, which include other family members such as grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins, are seen as the norm.
The common view is that the nuclear family has become the norm in many Western societies as a result of industrialization and urbanization. The trend towards nuclear families meant that many of the duties and responsibilities of a family, such as providing food and shelter, cleaning the home, preparing the food, caring for children and their education, and caring for the sick and elderly are no longer shared among the members of the extended family. The parents now have to do this, with some help from the state. However, this is the price that people pay for the higher standard of living that may come from living in a city.
