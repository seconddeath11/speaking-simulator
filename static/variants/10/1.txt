The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a revolving observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is the world’s largest observation wheel and most popular paid tourist attraction in the UK. Drawing visitors from all over the world, the wheel has transformed London’s landscape and stands today as a national symbol that celebrates Britain’s innovation and technological success in the 21st century.
The 32 capsules of the Eye are symbolic of London’s 32 boroughs and are numbered 1 to 33, eliminating the thirteenth carriage for good luck. Measuring at a height of 443 ft (135 metres), the wheel offers some of the greatest panoramic views of the city, on a good day stretching as far as 25 miles. The London Eye continues to attract approximately 15,000 visitors a day and has won more than 40 awards for its significant contribution to London’s tourism and architectural landscape.
