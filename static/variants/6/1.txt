You have 1.5 minutes to read the text silently, then be ready to read it out aloud. You will not have more than 1.5 minutes to read it.
The Cheese Rolling Festival takes place at Cooper’s Hill, in England. What started off as a local tradition has become an international event, drawing thousands of people from around the world.
A round cheese weighing 3 to 4 kilos (or 7 to 9 pounds) is rolled down the steep Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, pursued by the competitors. The aim is to catch the cheese, but as the round can reach speeds up to 70 mph, this is most unlikely.
In 2013, an Australian caught a cheese made of lightweight foam that had been introduced for safety reasons. In 2019 there were five cheese rolling races, including one for women, which was won by Flo Early, her fourth victory, making her the most successful female cheese rolling chaser. The male record stands with Chris Anderson who has won the race 22 times, although he did not compete in 2019 following his retirement from the event.
