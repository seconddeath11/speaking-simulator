Imagine that you are preparing a project with your friend. You have found some interesting material for the presentation and you want to read this text to your friend. You have 1.5 minutes to read the text silently, then be ready to read it out aloud. You will not have more than 1.5 minutes to read it.
Global warming and climate change are becoming a greater threat the longer we resist doing something about it on a massive scale. Though we’re already seeing its effects in droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, and unprecedented temperature extremes both high and low, it’s not too late to slow it down and mitigate the effects.
Global warming is known as the gradual rise in temperature caused by the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is not harmful itself. In fact, Earth wouldn’t be warm enough to sustain life without it. It’s the cumulative effect greenhouse gases have in conjunction with fossil fuels that make the effect dangerous. When coal, oil, and natural gas are burned, they release enormous amounts of greenhouses gases ‒ especially CO2, which is the most prevalent.
