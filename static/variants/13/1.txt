A cloud is water vapour in the atmosphere that has condensed into very small water droplets or ice crystals that appear in visible shapes or formations above the ground. Water on the Earth turns into an invisible gas and rises up into the sky. Higher up where the air is colder, the water condenses: it changes from a gas to drops of water or crystals of ice. We see these drops of water as clouds. The drops fall back down to earth as rain, and then the water evaporates again. This is called the “water cycle”. The atmosphere always has some water vapour. Clouds are heavy. The water in a cloud can have a mass of several million tons. Every cubic metre of the cloud has only about 5 grams of water in it. Cloud droplets are also about 1000 times heavier than evaporated water, so they are much heavier than air. They do not fall, but stay in the air, because there is warm air all round the heavier water droplets. When water changes from gas to droplets, this makes heat. Because the droplets are very small, they “stick” to the warm air.
